# LumiNUS Downloader

This downloader compares your local directory to LumiNUS, and pulls all new
files and folders from LumiNUS into the appropriate location in your local directory.

### ðŸŒ… Sunsetting LumiNUS Downloader

*This project will no longer be supported as of June 2022.*
I'll be leaving NUS soon, and so will lose my access to LumiNUS and my ability to test its features.
More importantly, NUS will be [migrating to Canvas](https://nus.edu.sg/canvas/) in AY2022/23,
leaving both LumiNUS and this downloader largely obsolete.

Nevertheless, feel free to continue using this project if it remains useful to you.
If there are any new issues, I'll try to see if I can fix them; otherwise, feel free to fork this repository to make any necessary changes. 

I'm glad to know that others have found this downloader useful,
and am grateful to everyone who's contributed to this project.
Good luck, and best wishes to everyone in NUS!

## Setting up

### User credentials (optional)

In the `config` directory, create a file `credentials.yaml` with the following details:
* `username`: NUSNET username
* `password`: NUSNET password

If `credentials.yaml` is absent, the user will be prompted for these details, and the file will be saved automatically.

### Module mapping

In the `config` directory, copy `modules_example.yaml` into a new file `modules.yaml`. It should have the following:
- The top line should be the path of your desired local directory, *relative to your home directory*.
  This is where all your LumiNUS modules will be stored.
- Each of the following lines should map one LumiNUS module to its corresponding sub-folder in your local directory.
  A line should have the format `<Local sub-folder name>: <LumiNUS module name>`.

## Running the script

Ensure that you have 7-Zip available, through `sudo apt install p7zip-full` or `brew install p7zip`.

Run `npm install`, then run the main script using `node main.js`.

Options:
- `--silent` or `-s`: No printing (apart from errors)
- `--timeout` or `-t`: Timeout per request in ms, defaults to 5000
- `--no-save` or `-n`: Will not save your login credentials to a local file
- `--reset-credentials` or `-r`: Reset login credentials
